into programming languages ....<br></p><p><h4>CACM-2513</h4>...in particular , the algorithm requires no storage other than the new nodes into which the list is to be moved , and no additional bits per node for marking ; the algorithm runs in time proportional to the number <b> of </b>nodes in the list...<br></p><p><h4>CACM-1458</h4>...when the transition has been made from off line to online programming , there are a number <b> of </b>changes in the working conditions...<br></p><p><h4>CACM-1165</h4>...the emulator makes use <b> of </b>both hardware micro-program routines and software routines to accomplish its function ....<br></p><p><h4>CACM-3158</h4>...each user is responsible for his own security and need not rely on the security <b> of </b>the central facility or the...<br></p><p><h4>CACM-2863</h4>...the results <b> of </b>simulating vmin , denning 's working set , and the page partitioning replacement algorithms on five virtual memory programs are presented to demonstrate the improvement possible over the known realizable variable space algorithms ....<br></p><p><h4>CACM-2954</h4>...the distinctive feature <b> of </b>this algorithm is a technique for traversing the structure twice , using the same spanning tree in each case , first from left to right and then from right to left ....<br></p><p><h4>CACM-2766</h4>...the only restriction on the algorithm given here is that the copy must be placed into a contiguous section <b> of </b>memory...<br></p><p><h4>CACM-1523</h4>...implementation time was approximately six man-years , with the majority <b> of </b>the code being written in fortran ....<br></p><p><h4>CACM-2855</h4>...some variations and extensions <b> of </b>the algorithm are discussed ....<br></p><p><h4>CACM-2439</h4>...this paper describes how this multiple-terminal facility was implemented without requiring any changes in the system executive or in any <b> of </b>the system 's compilers or interpreters ....<br></p><p><h4>CACM-2288</h4>...an outline for designing an information retrieval system based on the consecutive retrieval property is also discussed ....<br></p><p><h4>CACM-3053</h4>...introduction <b> of </b>frequency weights further improves retrievals...<br></p><p><h4>CACM-1869</h4>...two modifications to snobol are described , resulting in two desirable consequences : ( 1 ) naming constraints disappear even when there is indirect addressing within function definitions ; and ( 2 ) there is a significant saving in the number <b> of </b>calls to the garbage collector...<br></p><p><h4>CACM-2898</h4>...a sequential programming language forces the programmer to prescribe explicitly the order in which the operations in his program have to be executed , even if the order is not relevant to the solution <b> of </b>his problem...<br></p><p></p></body></html>
