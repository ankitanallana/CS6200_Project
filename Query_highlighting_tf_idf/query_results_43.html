demands for enhancements and extension constitute the most important management problem area ....<br></p><p><h4>CACM-2189</h4>...every set <b> <b> of </b></b>edges { e [ k ] } , 1 < = e [ k ] < = k , 3 < = k < = ( n-1 ) is determined recursively <b> <b> by </b></b>constructing a hamiltonian circuit with k vertices from a hamiltonian circuit with k-1 vertices , starting with the hamiltonian circuit <b> <b> of </b></b>3 vertices...<br></p><p><h4>CACM-2308</h4>...the <b> computer </b>can be , if properly used , with respect for human dignity <b> <b> and </b></b>civil liberty , a significant factor

transformation equations relating the curvilinear coordinates <b> <b> of </b></b>interest to an orthogonal cartesian triad...<br></p><p><h4>CACM-2188</h4>...each subsystem is chosen from large numbers <b> <b> of </b></b>alternatives ; the selection is based on considerations such as system response time , system cost , <b> <b> and </b></b>the distribution <b> <b> of </b></b>data storage <b> <b> and </b></b>processing between the graphics processor and its supporting data processing system...<br></p><p><h4>CACM-2215</h4>...in particular , one can incorporate the `` mini average backing-up
